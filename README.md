# Linux: Active Directory Integration for Ubuntu

## Introduction
In the enterprise world, most servers run on Linux operating systems. Embark on a journey to integrate Ubuntu Server (UbuntuServer00) into the existing Active Directory environment (mydomain.com). This project aims for centralized user credential management, heightened security and a seamless user experience.

 ### Let's break it down:

1. **Linux**: Linux is an operating system, much like Windows or macOS. It's known for being open-source, meaning anyone can view, modify and distribute its source code. Many servers and devices, including Android smartphones, run on Linux because of its stability, security and flexibility.

2. **Ubuntu**: Ubuntu is a popular distribution (or "flavor") of Linux. Think of it as a specific version of Linux tailored for ease of use and reliability. It's widely used in both personal and enterprise environments, offering a user-friendly interface and a vast repository of software applications.

3. **Active Directory**: Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft technology primarily used in Windows-based environments for managing users, computers and other resources on a network. It provides centralized authentication, authorization and management services, allowing administrators to control access to various network resources and enforce security policies.

4. **SSSD (System Security Services Daemon)**: SSSD is a service commonly used in Linux environments to facilitate integration with centralized identity and authentication systems, such as Active Directory. It enables Linux systems to authenticate users against AD and access resources like files, printers and applications that are managed within the Active Directory domain.

Now, how do they connect?

Ubuntu, a distribution of Linux, serves as the operating system for various devices or servers within an organization. On the other hand, Active Directory is a centralized identity management system typically associated with Windows environments. However, with the help of SSSD, Ubuntu systems can seamlessly integrate with Active Directory.

In practical terms, this means that employees can use their Active Directory credentials (username and password) to log in to Ubuntu machines, access shared files and printers and utilize other resources managed by Active Directory. This integration simplifies user management for IT administrators, ensures consistency across the network and enhances security by centralizing authentication processes.

## Process/Procedure Overview

## Pre-Installation Checks
**1. Check if the IP address is assigned by our domain controller and in the DHCP scope we created in Active Directory Lab.**
   ![IPconfig](https://github.com/rasheedjimoh/UbuntuAD/assets/157264080/20e383f3-b9ce-441e-b8a0-005dda6706ce)
**2. Verify SSH is working form DC(domain controller)**
   ![SSH-from-DC](https://github.com/rasheedjimoh/UbuntuAD/assets/157264080/12f58d22-1335-453f-888f-cd56b86d9aef)
**3. Verify the date, time and timezone.**

## Problem: Inability to join DC because of reverse DNS
**Try joining the domain after everything is in place but unable to so we troubleshot and find the problem.**
![rdns-problem](https://github.com/rasheedjimoh/UbuntuAD/assets/157264080/17f88038-a0f8-4086-9b3a-1a4fe7d1392a)

## Resolution
**Reverse DNS(rdns) set to false: To be able to successfullyÂ join the domain, You have to edit the /etc/krb5.conf and set rdns to false like this then restart**
![rdns-set-false](https://github.com/rasheedjimoh/UbuntuAD/assets/157264080/d1d0f01f-0749-4225-9785-cb7accc3446b)

## Configuration file modifications
Entries added to the krb5.conf file:
udp_preference_limit = 0: This entry sets the preference for using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) over UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for communication. A value of 0 means that TCP is preferred.
rdns = False: This entry disables reverse DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. It prevents the system from trying to find the hostname associated with an IP address.
dns_lookup_kdc = True: This entry enables DNS (Domain Name System) lookup for Key Distribution Center (KDC) servers. KDC is a component of Kerberos responsible for authentication.
dns_lookup_realms = True: This entry enables DNS lookup for Kerberos realms. It allows the system to use DNS to locate Kerberos realms.
![krb5.conf](https://github.com/rasheedjimoh/UbuntuAD/assets/157264080/f2321536-ac1d-4db4-9256-c286bfca97fd)

Entries added to the sssd.conf file:
krb5_keytab = /etc/krb5.keytab: This entry specifies the location of the Kerberos keytab file (krb5.keytab). The keytab file contains keys for service principals and is used for authentication.
ldap_keytab_init_creds = True: This entry, when set to True, instructs SSSD to use the credentials stored in the keytab file (krb5.keytab) for initiating LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) operations.
